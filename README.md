Farmer-Vendor Application

The app is built using flutter and dart

How it will work:
Farmers and traders with smartphones will have direct interaction with the mobile application. 
The application will provide an interface for a feed which will contain current and historical 
market information and related advertisements. The feed will be accessed without the person 
having to own an account and when they pick interest, they can sign up and have direct 
interactions with other users. 
There will be an option for buying or selling where the user will be required to input details 
about the product that they are interested in buying or selling that is name of product, price of 
product, the location of the product and what group of people they may need to sell too. The 
details will then be analyzed by the application, especially the price to make sure it is in line with 
the current market price. After validation of details, the details will be submitted to every user’s 
feed.

For the case of those who can’t access smart phones, they can decide to sign up with an agent 
who will request for their personal information such as phone contact, name, location and kind 
of produce they major in. The application will have an option for agent logins where they have 
access to an interface different from the rest of the users, from which they will submit the 
different details of the clients and the system will store and send out live feeds as direct 
messages to the registered phone numbers on the system.
There will be a reply option for the users to show interest in a particular product when posted or 
make it known that they are in possession of the specific product. The option will have a guide 
for the users to input the product details which the system will capture and verify just as with 
the direct use of the application.
There will be an option for the user to select a specific language of interest in which their feed 
should appear. 
The app will just act as a communication channel but will not be involved or responsible for the 
transactions. The users will communicate through calls or chat with one another directly using 
the phone numbers submitted.
Who canhaveaccess:
Farmers, Traders, Market vendors as well as individuals who may show interest of any kind.
Services:
Live feeds, Alerts in case of products on demand or sale, Alerts when a given product has been 
sold or when a given vendor gets what they needed.
